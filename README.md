I am a husband, cellist, system administrator, tech nerd, and all-around good guy. The repositories
here represent some of my explorations into programming and development.

I work for [Kansas State University](https://www.ksu.edu "Kansas State University") in their
[IT](https://www.k-state.edu/it/about/ "IT") department. Ours is a hybrid data center so I gaining
more experience in [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com "AWS").

My domain, [zanshin.net](https://zanshin.net) has been active since February 1996. With over 2,200
postings it represents a sizable chuck of my life. Recently the postings have all been technology
focused.

Away from technology I am a cellist. I'm an adult beginner with just over 11 years of practice under
my belt. In a karate-do dojo we'd say I was good student. I sometimes capture my musical life at the
[Music](https://music.zanshin.net "Music") subdomain of my main site.

Of all the repositories here, the [dotfiles](https://github.com/zanshin/dotfiles) is the most
popular with 294 stars and 75 forks. It is also the most active as I am constantly tweaking one or
more aspects of my environment. I have a separate dotfiles repository, called
[neuepunkte](https://github.com/zanshin/neuepunkte "neuepunkte") where I keep my Linux specific
configurations. The [bin](https://github.com/zanshin/bin "bin") repository has scripts in bash, python, perl, and ruby, among others.

Most recently I've been spending much of my free time delving deeper and deeper into
[Go](https:/golang.org "Go Language"). Consequently several recent repositories have been Go
focused.

I can be contacted via [markhnichols.com](https://markhnichols.com "Mark H. Nichols").
